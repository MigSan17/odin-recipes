                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Now that you have probably got the all the ingredients listed above.
        It's time to get into knit and gritty of making the pizza.
        So, let's move on to the <strong>Method</strong> of making the pizza.
        </p>
        <h3>The Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Preheat the oven</h4></li>
                <p> First off, you want to preheat the oven to 260 degrees Celsius</p>
            <li><h4>Make the sauce</h4></li>
                <p>Using the sauce ingredients above, stir ingredients togther.</p>
                <p><em>Note: The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza, if making more pizzas - simply doublt the amount</em></p>
            <li><h4>Roll out the dough</h4></li>
                <p>Roll dough on lightly floured surface. If rolling is too strenuous, let the dough rest in room temperature for 5 minutes.
                    For large pizza, aim to roll dough into a circle with a 36-centimeter diameter
                </p>
            <li><h4>Add the toppings:</h4></li>
                <p>Transfer dough to a lightly dusted cast-iron/skillet.</p>
                <p>Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, but don't forget to leave about
                    a 3 to 5 centimeter crust on the outer edges.
                </p>
                <p>Next chop half of the pepperoni slices and generously sprinkle it over the sauce.
                    Then, finish off the pizza prep, by topping the pizza with grated cheese and leftover pepperoni slices.
                    Finally, season it with black pepper.
                </p>
            <li><h4>Cook the pizza</h4></li>
                <p>Use your pizza skillet and place it over a high heat burner for around 2 minutes for preheat but also
                    getting the crust to cook right. Then transfer to the oven set already at 260 degrees Celsius and bake for 10
                    to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
                </p>
            <li><h4>Slice and serve</h4></li>
                <p>Take out the skillet and let the pizza rest for a minuter. Next, slice the pizza into pieces and season with oregano - if you'r that fancy.
                    <em>Voila!</em> You're pizza is ready and waiting for you to eat it all :) 
                </p>
